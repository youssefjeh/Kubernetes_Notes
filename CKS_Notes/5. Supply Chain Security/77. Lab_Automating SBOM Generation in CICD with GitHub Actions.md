# 🧪 Lab: Automating SBOM Generation in CICD with GitHub Actions

---

## 🎯 **Learning Outcomes**

By completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Understand the importance of **automated SBOM generation** in CI/CD pipelines.
* Configure a **GitHub Actions workflow** for SBOM creation.
* Use **Syft** to generate SBOMs in **SPDX-JSON** format during CI.
* Upload SBOMs as **artifacts** using GitHub Actions.
* **Trigger** and **download** SBOM artifacts from GitHub UI.

## ✅ Step 1: Configure GitHub Credentials in Lab Environment

### 🎯 Objective:

Store your GitHub repo owner and access token for later tasks.

### 🧪 Instructions:

Create the credentials file:

```bash
vi /root/github_repo_info.json
```

Add your GitHub info:

```json
{
  "REPO_OWNER": "your_username_here",
  "ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_access_token_here"
}
```

## ✅ Step 2: Fork the Base Repository

### 🎯 Objective:

Create your own copy of the starter GitHub repo.

### 🧪 Instructions:

1. Navigate to: [https://github.com/iampsrv/supply\_chain\_security](https://github.com/iampsrv/supply_chain_security)
2. Click the **Fork** button (top right).
3. Ensure the fork is named: `supply_chain_security` (default).
4. Navigate to the forked repo in your GitHub account.
5. Locate:

   * `nginx-sbom.json`
   * `nginx-spdx.sbom`
   * `.github/workflows/main.yml`
6. Go to the **Actions** tab and click “**I understand my workflows**” to enable GitHub Actions.

## ✅ Step 3: Modify Workflow to Generate SBOM for a Different Image

### 🎯 Objective:

Update the CI workflow to scan a **different container image** and output in **SPDX-JSON** format.

### 🔧 Changes in `.github/workflows/main.yml`:

* Change image from `nginx:latest` to `kodekloud/webapp-color:latest`
* Change output format from `cyclonedx-xml` to `spdx-json`
* Rename artifact file to `spdx.json`
* Upgrade `upload-artifact` from v3 to **v4**

### 🧪 Updated `main.yml`:

```yaml
name: Generate SBOM Report with Syft

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  generate-sbom:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Install Syft
      run: |
        curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/syft/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

    - name: Generate SBOM
      run: |
        syft docker.io/kodekloud/webapp-color:latest -o spdx-json > spdx.json

    - name: Upload SBOM Artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: sbom-report
        path: spdx.json
```

---

## ✅ Step 4: Enable Manual Workflow Triggering

### 🎯 Objective:

Allow the SBOM workflow to be triggered manually via the GitHub UI.

### 🔧 Add `workflow_dispatch` event:

Update the top of your workflow YAML to include:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # <-- Added to enable manual run
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
```

### 💡 Also modify artifact name:

In the upload step:

```yaml
    - name: Upload SBOM Artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: spdx-report   # <-- renamed for clarity
        path: spdx.json
```

---

## ✅ Step 5: Trigger Workflow and Download SBOM Artifact

### 🎯 Objective:

Manually run the workflow and retrieve the generated SBOM.

### 🧪 Instructions:

1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub.
2. Click the **Actions** tab.
3. Select the workflow **“Generate SBOM Report with Syft”**.
4. Click the **“Run workflow”** button on the right.
5. Choose the `main` branch and click **Run workflow**.
6. Wait for the job to complete (1–2 minutes).

---

## ✅ Step 6: Download the Generated SBOM from GitHub UI

### 📥 Steps to Download Artifact:

1. In the **Actions** tab, open the most recent run.
2. Click the job (e.g., `generate-sbom`) to view logs.
3. Scroll to the bottom to see the **Artifacts** section.
4. Click on **`spdx-report`** to download the `.zip` file.
5. Unzip it to get the `spdx.json`.

---

## 🧪 Bonus: Examine the `spdx.json`

Use a tool like `jq` or VS Code to explore the contents:

```bash
jq '.' spdx.json | less
```

Look for:

* SPDX ID, version
* Packages and licenses
* Relationships between components
