# Editing a POD

## Restrictions on Editing a POD

Remember, you **CANNOT** edit specifications of an existing POD other than the following fields:

- `spec.containers[*].image`
- `spec.initContainers[*].image`
- `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds`
- `spec.tolerations`

For example, you cannot edit environment variables, service accounts, or resource limits (all of which we will discuss later) of a running pod. 

## Options for Editing Non-Editable Fields

If you really need to make changes to non-editable fields, you have two options:

### Option 1: Using `kubectl edit pod`

1. Run the following command to open the pod specification in an editor (e.g., `vi`):
   ```bash
   kubectl edit pod <pod-name>
   ```
2. Edit the required properties. When you try to save the file, you will be denied because the field you are trying to edit is not editable.
3. A copy of the file with your changes will be saved in a temporary location. For example:
   ```
   /tmp/kubectl-edit-ccvrq.yaml
   ```
4. Delete the existing pod using the following command:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
   ```
5. Create a new pod with your changes using the temporary file:
   ```bash
   kubectl create -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-ccvrq.yaml
   ```

### Option 2: Exporting and Recreating the POD

1. Export the pod definition in YAML format to a file using the following command:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml > my-new-pod.yaml
   ```
2. Edit the exported file using an editor (e.g., `vi`):
   ```bash
   vi my-new-pod.yaml
   ```
3. Save the changes.
4. Delete the existing pod:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
   ```
5. Create a new pod with the edited file:
   ```bash
   kubectl create -f my-new-pod.yaml
   ```

## Editing Deployments

For deployments, you can easily edit any field/property of the pod template. Since the pod template is part of the deployment specification, any change to the deployment will automatically delete and recreate pods with the updated changes.

To edit a property of a pod that is part of a deployment, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl edit deployment <my-deployment>
