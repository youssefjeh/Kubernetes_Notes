# Kubectx and Kubens – Command-line Utilities


In a real-world Kubernetes cluster deployed for production, you may often need to switch between numerous namespaces and clusters.

Using `kubectl` alone for this can quickly become a confusing and overwhelming task. 

This is where command-line tools such as `kubectx` and `kubens` come into play.
