# Working with ETCDCTL

`etcdctl` is a command-line client for etcd.

In all our Kubernetes Hands-on labs, the ETCD key-value database is deployed as a static pod on the master. The version used is v3.

## Setting Up ETCDCTL

To make use of `etcdctl` for tasks such as backup and restore, make sure that you set the `ETCDCTL_API` to 3.

You can do this by exporting the variable `ETCDCTL_API` prior to using the `etcdctl` client. This can be done as follows:

```bash
export ETCDCTL_API=3
```

On the Master Node:

```bash
master$ etcdctl -v
etcdctl version: 3.3.13
API version: 3.3 
```

## Exploring Options

To see all the options for a specific sub-command, make use of the `-h` or `--help` flag.

For example, if you want to take a snapshot of etcd, use:

```bash
etcdctl snapshot save -h
```

Make sure to note the mandatory global options.

## Working with a TLS-Enabled ETCD Database

Since our ETCD database is TLS-Enabled, the following options are mandatory:

- `--cacert`: Verify certificates of TLS-enabled secure servers using this CA bundle.
- `--cert`: Identify secure client using this TLS certificate file.
- `--endpoints=[127.0.0.1:2379]`: This is the default as ETCD is running on the master node and exposed on localhost 2379.
- `--key`: Identify secure client using this TLS key file.

## Snapshot Restore

Similarly, use the help option for snapshot restore to see all available options for restoring the backup:

```bash
etcdctl snapshot restore -h
```
