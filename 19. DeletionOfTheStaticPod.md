# Deleting a Static Pod: `static-greenbox`

Follow these steps to identify and delete the static pod named `static-greenbox`.

## Step 1: Identify the Node Hosting the Pod

Run the following command to locate the node where the `static-greenbox` pod is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | grep static-greenbox
```

Example output:
```plaintext
default       static-greenbox-node01    1/1   Running   0   19s   10.244.1.2   node01   <none>   <none>
```

From the output, you can see the pod is running on **node01**.

---

## Step 2: SSH into the Node and Locate the Static Pod Configuration Path

1. SSH into `node01`:
   ```bash
   ssh node01
   ```

2. Check the kubelet process to find the configuration file path:
   ```bash
   ps -ef | grep /usr/bin/kubelet
   ```

   Example output:
   ```plaintext
   root 4147 1 0 14:05 ? 00:00:00 /usr/bin/kubelet --config=/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml ...
   ```

3. Search for the static pod path in the kubelet configuration file:
   ```bash
   grep -i staticpod /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
   ```

   Example output:
   ```plaintext
   staticPodPath: /etc/just-to-mess-with-you
   ```

   The static pod configuration path is `/etc/just-to-mess-with-you`.

---

## Step 3: Delete the Static Pod YAML File

1. Navigate to the directory containing the static pod YAML file:
   ```bash
   cd /etc/just-to-mess-with-you
   ```

2. Verify the file exists:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

   Example output:
   ```plaintext
   greenbox.yaml
   ```

3. Delete the static pod file:
   ```bash
   rm -rf greenbox.yaml
   ```

4. Exit the node:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

---

## Step 4: Verify Deletion of the Static Pod

Return to the control plane node and confirm that the pod has been deleted:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | grep static-greenbox
```

If no output is returned, the static pod has been successfully deleted.
