# Lab - Implementing Tenant Isolation in a Kubernetes Cluster

---

## An1 - Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to implement tenant isolation in a Kubernetes cluster using node taints and tolerations. By applying taints to nodes and tolerations to pods, you can control which pods are scheduled on which nodes based on team or tenant requirements.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Apply taints to nodes to restrict pod placement for tenant isolation.
- Create namespaces and pods with tolerations to allow scheduling on specific nodes.
- Validate that pods are correctly scheduled according to the taints and tolerations.

---

## An2 - Taint Nodes for Tenant Isolation

Apply taints to all the worker nodes in your Kubernetes cluster to enforce tenant isolation.

**Taint labels:**

- `team=team-a` on `node01`
- `team=team-b` on `node02`
- `team=team-c` on `node03`

This will ensure that only pods with the appropriate tolerations can be scheduled on specific nodes.

### Solution

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node01 team=team-a:NoSchedule
kubectl taint nodes node02 team=team-b:NoSchedule
kubectl taint nodes node03 team=team-c:NoSchedule
````

These commands apply a `NoSchedule` taint to each node, preventing pods without matching tolerations from being scheduled on them.

---

## An3 - Create Namespaces for Each Team

Create the following namespaces to organize resources and enforce boundaries:

* `team-a`
* `team-b`
* `team-c`

### Solution

```bash
kubectl create namespace team-a
kubectl create namespace team-b
kubectl create namespace team-c
```

---

## An4 - Deploy Pods with Tolerations

For each team namespace, deploy a pod with the appropriate tolerations so that it can be scheduled on its designated node.

| Team   | Pod Name   | Namespace | Tolerations              | Image |
| ------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------------------ | ----- |
| team-a | team-a-pod | team-a    | `team=team-a:NoSchedule` | nginx |
| team-b | team-b-pod | team-b    | `team=team-b:NoSchedule` | nginx |
| team-c | team-c-pod | team-c    | `team=team-c:NoSchedule` | nginx |

### Solution

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: team-a-pod
  namespace: team-a
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  tolerations:
  - key: "team"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "team-a"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: team-b-pod
  namespace: team-b
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  tolerations:
  - key: "team"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "team-b"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: team-c-pod
  namespace: team-c
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  tolerations:
  - key: "team"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "team-c"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```

---

## An5 - Validate Tenant Isolation

Verify that each team's pod is scheduled on the correct node.

Run the following commands to check the node assignments:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n team-a -o wide
kubectl get pods -n team-b -o wide
kubectl get pods -n team-c -o wide
```

Ensure that:

* `team-a-pod` is running on `node01`
* `team-b-pod` is running on `node02`
* `team-c-pod` is running on `node03`

---

## An6 - Test Cross-Team Scheduling (Optional)

Attempt to deploy a pod **without** the appropriate tolerations in the `team-a` namespace and observe the scheduling behavior.

Determine if the pod is scheduled or remains in the Pending state.

### Solution

Create the pod without tolerations:

```bash
kubectl run test-pod -n team-a --image=busybox --restart=Never -- sleep 3600
```

Check the pod status:

```bash
kubectl get pod test-pod -n team-a
```

Since the pod lacks the necessary tolerations, it should remain in the **Pending** state because it cannot be scheduled on any tainted nodes.

Example output:

```
test-pod     0/1     Pending   0          6s
```

---

## An7 - Remove the Taints from the Nodes

Remove the taints applied to the nodes to allow pods to be scheduled without restrictions.

### Solution

Check existing taints:

```bash
kubectl describe node node01 | grep -i taint
```

Remove the taints:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes node01 team=team-a:NoSchedule-
kubectl taint nodes node02 team=team-b:NoSchedule-
kubectl taint nodes node03 team=team-c:NoSchedule-
```

---

## An8 - Validate Pod Scheduling After Removing Taints

Now that you have removed the taints from the nodes, check the status of the `test-pod` in the `team-a` namespace; it should now be in the **Running** state.

```bash
kubectl get pod test-pod -n team-a
```

Expected output:

```
NAME       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
test-pod   1/1     Running   0          5m10s
```
