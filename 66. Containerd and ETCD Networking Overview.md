# Containerd and ETCD Networking Overview

## Overview
This repository documents the network configuration and behavior of Containerd and ETCD in a Kubernetes control plane environment. It includes a breakdown of network interfaces created by Containerd and insights into ETCD port usage.

## Containerd Networking on the Control Plane Node
When using Containerd as the container runtime, various network interfaces and bridges are configured on the control plane node. These are crucial for enabling container networking and node communication.

### Key Interfaces:
1. **`cni0`**:
   - A virtual network bridge created by the Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin.
   - Connects containers within the node through veth pairs.

2. **`flannel.1`**:
   - An overlay network interface created by Flannel for pod-to-pod communication across nodes.

3. **`eth0@if14427`**:
   - A physical or virtual network interface for node-level communication, including connections to other nodes and external networks.

4. **`veth` Pairs**:
   - Virtual Ethernet interfaces linking containers to the `cni0` bridge.

## ETCD Port Usage and Connection Details
ETCD, a key component of Kubernetes, listens on two main ports:

1. **Port 2379**:
   - Handles client connections.
   - Used by Kubernetes control plane components such as the API server.

2. **Port 2380**:
   - Used for ETCD peer-to-peer communication.
   - Relevant only in multi-node ETCD setups.

### Checking Active Connections
Run the following commands to determine the number of active connections to each ETCD port:

```bash
# Check connections to port 2380
netstat -anp | grep etcd | grep 2380 | wc -l

# Check connections to port 2379
netstat -anp | grep etcd | grep 2379 | wc -l
```

### Example Output
```plaintext
root@controlplane:~# netstat -anp | grep etcd | grep 2380 | wc -l
1
root@controlplane:~# netstat -anp | grep etcd | grep 2379 | wc -l
81
```

> **Note:** Port 2379 typically has more connections since it is used by Kubernetes components. Port 2380 is used only in multi-node ETCD setups.
